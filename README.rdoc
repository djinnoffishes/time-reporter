== Time reporter

This sends email reports for logged hours in Tilting Point project, every week.

How it works:

- There's a rake task in lib/tasks/schedule.rake that grabs a template from mailers/report_mailer and delivers it to some email recipients via sendgrid. 
- The task checks if Time.now is Friday, and the hosted version (https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/time-reporter) uses Heroku's Scheduler to run every day at 12PM PST.
- You can edit the sender, replyto, and recipients list in report_mailer.rb
